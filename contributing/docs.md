# Contribute to the docs

Like Simpla itself, this documentation is entirely open-source and  [available on GitHub](https://github.com/simplaio/docs). If you spot an error or see something you can contribute to, make a pull request! Just click the _Edit this page_ button at the top of the page you want to edit, or create a PR directly against the docs repo on Github.

Documentation is written in [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown/).  If you've used GitHub, it's pretty likely you've encountered it before. It's built into this site with [GitBook](https://github.com/GitbookIO/gitbook).

## Organization

Each page in the docs is its own markdown file in the [GitHub repo](https://gitub.com/simplaio/docs), and these files are organized in a nice logical file structure. Each section (eg: [Guides](/guides)) is a folder (eg: `/guides/`). Every section folder has a `README.md`, which displays as its index page.

There is also an `assets/` folder which contains supporting assets (images, stylesheets, etc) used by the docs.

## Table of Contents

The documentation's structure is defined in a global table of contents in the [`SUMMARY.md`](https://github.com/simplaio/docs/blob/master/SUMMARY.md) file. It's a netsted list of markdown links.

## Overview page

The root [`README.md`](https://github.com/simplaio/docs/blob/master/README.md) is the documentation home summary (ie: [Overview](/)), it's purpose is to orient new readers, and also give a quick elevator pitch of what Simpla is.
